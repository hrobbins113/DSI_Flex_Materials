# Graduation Requirements

As data scientists, you will be expected to have many skills developed. Employers are looking for candidates who:
- Demonstrate technical proficiency from defining the business problem and gathering data to building and evaluating models
- Confidently speak in depth about the technical choices made
- Communicate competently to non-technical audiences
- Write clearly and about the work they do
- Recognize how their work impacts real-world decisions
It's not enough to simply develop these skills; you also have to **show employers** that you've mastered these skills!
At General Assembly, we'll spend the next twelve weeks working with you to develop these skills and showcase them to a variety of audiences.

### 1. Receive a passing grade on all course projects
You'll hear more details about these later, but you'll complete a series of projects designed to demonstrate mastery of the entire data science "pipeline" - from data collection to exploratory data analysis to modeling to writing up and presenting results.

If you do not receive a passing grade on **ONE** of the assignments, you will be given a 3 day extension to correct the materials.

If you fail to meet the standards for the projects, both instructor and student experience manager will have a conversation regarding how to move forward with the course.

### 2. Receive a passing grade on 80% of all assigned homework:  
* **Labs**
Most lessons will be followed by lab time so that you can directly put what we've just learned into practice. You'll work on problems that will connect lessons together, provide more real-world context for problems you'll see, and give you the opportunity to beef up on some of those less tangible aspects of data science like data cleaning and exploratory data analysis. This also gives us the opportunity to assess how you're doing and provide feedback to you so that you can grow as quickly as possible.
  * Labs are graded on the basis of completion (complete, incomplete, missing)
* **Portfolio**
Doing data science isn't new, but calling it "data science" is. There are very few people who have a degree in "data science" or have more than 5 years of experience as a "data scientist." This provides a unique opening for you to break into the data science field even if you don't have a background in mathematics or computing! The best way for you to showcase what you've learned and what you can do is through a portfolio.
  * Three (3) course projects, one of which must be your capstone project
  * Six (6) data science-related blog posts
Writing blog posts is the best way to gain notoriety as a data scientist. Check out these posts to get started:

* **Assessments**
  * Bi-weekly quizzes every other Friday (There will be one at the end of the first week.)
  * You have to do your best to pass.
### Additional data science blogs
> Note: Getting started can be tough, and we will provide some guidance for possible blog topics - but don't wait for guidance to get started! Write about what got you into data science, what excites you, and what's challenging. Capture it all while it's fresh! You can go back on a weekly basis and curate/edit a blog post out of that.
- A website hosting your portfolio and blog
- A static website is a way to curate your brand and to host your portfolio in a visually appealing way. It conveys a sense of professionalism and experience in the tech world.
### Attendance Policy
While attendance is in general important, being present throughout an immersive experience is **critical** for success. Students should strive to always be present for class.
- Students may be allowed up to 3 excused absences over the course
- 3 tardies or 3 early departures = 1 absence
- Given the nature of the connected classroom, Attendance is taken immediately at the start of the day and immediately after lunch.
- Attendance is taken twice a day. Missing a ½ day = ½ absence
- Students who are absent are responsible for connecting with their instructional team to catch up on what they missed
### Tuition
Tuition must be paid in full by the end of the course to receive a letter of completion (unless final payments are scheduled after end of course)

## During Normal Weeks

Outside of scheduled one-on-ones, you can always ask any instructor any question over the course of the day. If we're not around, please send one of us a Slack message -- we all live and breathe Slack!

We ask that you take the following steps when dealing with technical questions, e.g. "Why isn't my code working?"

1. Try something else
2. Look at Google and Stack Overflow
3. Ask your classmates
4. Ask an instructor

If we get the impression that you haven't tried the first three steps, we may push back and redirect you to Google, an article, or a lesson plan. It's not that we're mean or that we're too busy! We try hard to not just give anyone answers because that's not a sustainable approach to learning programming.

If it's clear that you've made a concerted effort to research the problem, then we'll be more than happy to help you figure things out. Usually the first question we'll ask is "What errors are you getting?"

If your question is **non-technical** -- for example, you're feeling overwhelmed, or you have questions about a homework or project prompt -- we'll do our best to address your concerns as quickly and thoroughly as possible.

## Outside Work Hours

**After 5:00 pm**, instructors are **not** expected to respond to **technical** questions. This is for our work-life balance as well as yours! There are, however, evening TA's that you can schedule appointments with to address after-hours technical questions. You can book time with them here: https://ectateam.youcanbook.me/
